    "r\" (Read mode): This is the default mode when no mode is specified. It opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist, it raises a FileNotFoundError error. When the file is opened in read mode, you can only read the contents of the file and not modify it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"w\" (Write mode): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates (clears) the contents of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. You can write data to the file using methods like write() or writelines(). Be cautious that opening a file in write mode will overwrite any existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"a\" (Append mode): This mode opens the file for appending data. If the file exists, the new data is written at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file. Existing data in the file remains intact, and new data is added to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"x\" (Exclusive creation mode): This mode opens the file for exclusive creation, which means it creates a new file and raises a FileExistsError if the file already exists. It is useful when you want to ensure that you are creating a new file without accidentally overwriting an existing file.\n",

    "\"b\" (Binary mode): This mode is used in combination with other modes to open the file in binary mode. It is used for reading or writing binary data, such as images, audio files, or any other non-text files.\n",

    "To open a file, you need to specify the file name or path as the first argument and the mode as the second argument in the open() function. Here's an example:\n",

    "The close() function is used to close a file that has been opened using the open() function in Python. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When a file is opened, system resources are allocated to it. By closing the file, you release these resources, freeing them up for other processes or operations. Failing to close a file can lead to resource leaks and potential issues when working with a large number of files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: Closing a file ensures that any buffered data is properly flushed and written to the file. Python uses buffering mechanisms to optimize file operations, and the close() function ensures that any remaining data in the buffer is written to the file before closing it. If you do not close the file, there is a chance that the final data may not be written, leading to incomplete or corrupted files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing File Locks: Closing a file releases any locks associated with the file. If a file is opened in write mode or is being accessed by another process, not closing the file may prevent other processes from accessing or modifying the file. Closing the file allows other processes to access it without conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Programming Practice: It is considered good programming practice to explicitly close files when you are done using them. It makes the code more readable and maintainable by clearly indicating the start and end of file operations. It also helps in preventing unintended side effects or unexpected behavior caused by leaving files open.\n",
    "\n",
    "To close a file, you can call the close() method on the file object, like this\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "# Perform operations on the file\n",
    "file.close()  # Close the file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "    The with statement in Python is used in conjunction with the open() function to ensure proper handling of files. It provides a convenient and safe way to open and close files, with automatic resource management, without the need for explicitly calling close().\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of using the with statement with open() is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Resource Management: When a file is opened using the open() function within a with statement, the file is automatically closed when the block of code within the with statement is exited, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. This ensures that the file is properly closed and system resources are released, even if there are errors or exceptions within the block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaner and More Readable Code: The with statement enhances code readability by clearly indicating the scope of file operations. It makes the code more structured and easier to understand, as it clearly defines the start and end of file-related operations. This helps prevent mistakes such as forgetting to close the file or closing it prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exception Safety: The with statement handles exceptions gracefully. If an exception occurs within the with block, the file is still automatically closed before the exception is propagated, preventing resource leaks and maintaining data integrity. It simplifies exception handling and ensures that file operations are safely managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the use of the with statement with open():\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    # Perform file operations within the block\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "# The file is automatically closed here, even if an exception occurs within the block\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the file \"example.txt\" is opened within the with statement using open(). The file object is assigned to the variable file. All file operations are performed within the indented block under the with statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the block is executed, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not, the file is automatically closed at the end of the with statement, ensuring proper resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the with statement with open() not only simplifies the code by handling resource management automatically, but also improves code robustness and readability by providing a structured and exception-safe approach to working with files.\n",

    "write(): The write() function is used to write a string of characters to a file. It appends the specified string to the existing content of the file or creates a new file if it doesn't exist. Here's an example:\n",

    "    \n",

    "writelines(): The writelines() function is used to write a list of strings to a file. Each string element in the list represents a line of text. Here's an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "# Open the file in write mode\n",

    "# Write the list of lines to the file\n",
    "file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close the file\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the writelines() function is used to write three lines of text to the file \"example.txt\". The lines are prepared as a list of strings, and the entire list is written to the file. Similar to the write() function, the writelines() function overwrites the existing content or creates a new file if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the write() and writelines() functions do not automatically append newlines (\\n) to the written content. If you want to separate lines, you need to explicitly include the newline character in the strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these functions, you can write text data to a file, allowing you to store and manipulate information persistently. Remember to close the file using the close() method after you have finished writing to ensure the data is properly saved and the resources are released.\n",
